# Sample Hardhat & React Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

In this project I took a general view on concepts such as:
-- Hardhat on Etherium VM,
-- Smart Contract on Solidity, 
-- Front-end development with React,
-- Back-end development using nodeJS,

and I learned:
-- For what purpose sites such as opensea, pinata are used?
-- What is ISTP Protocol and why it is useful?
-- How to write simple NFT game projects?
-- How to use web3js library
etc..
